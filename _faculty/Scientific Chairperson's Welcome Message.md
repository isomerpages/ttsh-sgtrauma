<p>It is my honor to welcome you to STACC 2025, where we gather to advance
the field of trauma and acute care surgery. This year's theme, "Navigating
Uncertainties, Inspiring Solutions, Building Resilience", reflects the
pressing challenges of our time - spanning political, environmental, and
healthcare domains - and underscores the vital need for innovative solutions
and resilience in addressing these complexities.</p>
<p>As Chair, I am privileged to work alongside a dedicated and dynamic Scientific
Committee composed of experts from diverse specialties. Together, we have
curated an engaging program that showcases cutting-edge research, fosters
multidisciplinary collaboration, and provides practical insights to tackle
the multifaceted challenges of current times.</p>
<p>STACC 2025 is more than a conference - it is an opportunity to connect,
learn, and drive innovation in trauma and acute care surgery. We look forward
to welcoming you to an enriching experience, one that will leave you inspired
and empowered to make a difference!</p>
