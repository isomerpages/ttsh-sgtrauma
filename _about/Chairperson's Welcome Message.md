<p>Dear Colleagues and Friends,</p>
<p>It is my honour to welcome you to the 15<sup>th </sup>edition of the Singapore
Trauma and Acute Care Conference (STACC). This year, we gather under the
theme: <em>Navigating Uncertainties, Inspiring Solutions, Building Resilience</em> -
a testament to the adaptability and innovation that have defined our journey
over the past two decades.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since its inception, this conference has evolved into a cornerstone event,
uniting local and regional experts to exchange insights, share best practices,
and advance trauma and acute care management. What began as a modest platform
has grown into a vibrant community, elevating collaboration across disciplines.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year's programme will reflect our commitment to address emerging
challenges and equipping practitioners with the tools and knowledge to
thrive in an unpredictable landscape. Through thought-provoking discussions
and shared experiences, we aim to inspire solutions that not only overcome
today's uncertainties but also shape a more resilient future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for joining us in this milestone year. Together, let us continue
to push boundaries and forge new paths in trauma and acute care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On behalf of the organising committee, I look forward to welcoming you
at STACC 2025.</p>
