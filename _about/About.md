<h2>Singapore Trauma and Acute Care Conference</h2>
<p>Singapore Trauma (ST) has come a long way since its beginnings in 2005
as a humble half-day update session, initially conceived as an extension
of the inaugural Definitive Surgical Trauma Care (DSTC) course. By 2007,
the event had evolved into a full-day conference dedicated exclusively
to advancing trauma care, laying the groundwork for its enduring mission
of knowledge-sharing and collaboration.</p>

<p>Recognizing the need to address trauma's multidisciplinary nature, ST
embraced further growth, transforming into a two-day conference and rebranding
as Singapore Trauma and Acute Care Conference (STACC) to reflect its broader
scope. Now, STACC stands as a premier platform that integrates diverse
disciplines—trauma, acute care, emergency medicine, orthopaedics, and more—united
by a shared commitment to improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Despite its significant expansion, STACC remains deeply rooted in its
founding principles: making high-quality education accessible to healthcare
professionals and fostering a spirit of collaboration across local, regional,
and global communities. Each edition is designed not only to share expertise
but also to inspire innovation and empower practitioners to navigate the
complexities of modern trauma care.</p>
