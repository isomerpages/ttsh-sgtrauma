<h2>Singapore Trauma and Acute Care Conference</h2>
<p>The Singapore Trauma and Acute Care Conference (STACC) has come a long
way since its beginnings in 2005 as a humble half-day update session, initially
conceived as an extension of the inaugural Definitive Surgical Trauma Care
(DSTC) course. By 2007, the event had evolved into a full-day conference
dedicated exclusively to advancing trauma care, laying the groundwork for
its enduring mission of knowledge-sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to address trauma's multidisciplinary nature, STACC
embraced further growth, transforming into a two-day conference and rebranding
to reflect its broader scope. Now, STACC stands as a premier platform that
integrates diverse disciplines—trauma, acute care, emergency medicine,
orthopaedics, and more—united by a shared commitment to improving patient
outcomes.</p>
<p>Despite its significant expansion, STACC remains deeply rooted in its
founding principles: making high-quality education accessible to healthcare
professionals and fostering a spirit of collaboration across local, regional,
and global communities. Each edition is designed not only to share expertise
but also to inspire innovation and empower practitioners to navigate the
complexities of modern trauma care.</p>
<p>As STACC continues to grow, it remains steadfast in its mission to bridge
gaps, break silos, and build a resilient network of professionals dedicated
to saving lives.</p>
